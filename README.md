This project is a fully functional E-Commerce Frontend Store built using ReactJS that simulates a real online shopping platform. The application follows a component-based architecture where the UI is divided into reusable components such as Navbar, ProductCard, CartItem, and Footer. It uses React Router to enable seamless navigation between pages like Home, Products, Product Details, and Cart without reloading the page. Product data is fetched dynamically from an external API (FakeStore API) using Axios, demonstrating real-world API integration and asynchronous data handling with React Hooks like useEffect and useState.

The project implements global state management using the Context API to manage cart functionality efficiently across the entire application. When a user adds products to the cart, the system intelligently tracks quantities instead of duplicating items, and dynamically calculates totals using array reduction logic. The UI is designed with responsive grid layouts and styled components to create a modern shopping experience. Features such as a sticky navigation bar, product rating display, dynamic subtotal calculations, and a structured checkout summary enhance usability and realism.

Overall, this project demonstrates core React concepts including JSX, component reusability, props, state management, hooks, routing, API integration, and deployment using Vercel. It reflects a practical understanding of frontend architecture and mirrors how real-world e-commerce platforms are structured, making it a strong portfolio-ready project.
